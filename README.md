## Disclaimer

- this is only a simulation and a working proof of concept for our project title 'Parcel delivery
alert'.
- this system and the devices are meant to be implement/install in the US neighborhood area.
- No SMS are sent during this simulation
- "Camera click" is to simulate the camera is taking a photo.

## Features
- file as input stream (reading from txt file. to simulate implementation of API request from e-commerce platform eg: get user orders that contains parcel barcode number, recipient name, and courier etc. from Shopee API and store the info locally in the program )
- Use macro to simplify the source code and reduce redundancy 
- barcode validation with database (memory)
- error handling (tell user the error and how to mitigate that error)
- Audio output ( using syscall 33 to output an audio via MIDI )
